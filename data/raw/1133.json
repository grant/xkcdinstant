It comes back home with them, but burns up without landing.\n[Apollo Service module]\n\nCold Air for burning (and breathing). This part had a *very* big problem once.\n[oxygen tank; was the tank that exploded during the Apollo 13 incident]\n\nPart that flies down to the other world with two people inside\n[Lunar Module]\n\nPart that stays on the other world (It's still there)\n[Lunar Module Descent Stage]\n\nFeet that go on the ground of the other world \n[Lunar Module Descent Stage landing gear]\n\nRing holding most of the computers\n[Instrument Unit]\n\nPart that falls off third (this part flew away from our world into space and hit the world we were going toward)\n[Third stage]\n\nThings holding that kind of air that makes your voice funny (It's for filling up the space left when they take the cold air out to burn it)\n[Helium tank]\n\nThe kind of air that once burned a big sky bag and people died and someone said \"Oh the [humans]!\" (used for burning) (wet and *very* cold)\n[Liquid Hydrogen tank]\n\nThe part of air you need to breathe, but not the other stuff (used for burning)(wet and *very* cold)\n[Liquid Oxygen tank]\n\nFire comes out here\n[J-2 Third stage engine]\n\nPart that falls off second\n[Second stage]\n\nMore sky bag air (for burning)(cold + wet)\n[Liquid Hydrogen tank, Second stage]\n\nMore breathing-type air (for burning)(cold + wet)\n[Liquid Oxygen tank, Second stage]\n\nThing that brings in cold wet air to burn\n[Fuel tank input, Second stage]\n\nFire comes out here\n[5 J-2 Second stage engines]\n\nPart that falls off first\n[First stage]\n\nMore breathing-type air (for burning)(cold + wet)\n[Liquid Oxygen tank, First stage]\n\nMore funny voice air (for filling up space)\n[Helium tank, First stage]\n\nOpening for putting in cold wet air\n[Liquid oxygen tank input, First stage]\n\nThis is full of that stuff they burned in lights before houses had power.
