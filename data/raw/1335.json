The outermost ring is split into a yellow semi-circle labeled at the top with \"noon\" and a gray semi-circle labeled at the bottom with \"midnight,\" with \"6 AM\" on the left and \"6 PM\" on the right. A second ring immediately inside the outer ring has two sections labeled, one \"Rude to call\" and the other \"Business hours (9-5)\" - the rest of that ring is blank.
